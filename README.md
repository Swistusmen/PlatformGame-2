# PlatformGame-2
Second try on platform game, currently working on

On this stage of work, the gameplay is flow. 


Problems:
-There is still a little problem with making enemies walking on platforms. 
-However the biggest problem for me is to make code more readable on which im working on now. My purpose is to make a class Interface
where whole logic happens (except of moving and commands), in the future I make double buffering-like mechanism to change levels this way. 

In the future:
-Make GameStates like: Menu, Starting View, Game, Winning etc
-Implement function which read data from file and initialize a Interface to make Levels in the game
-Implement things like: collected coins, points, taking damage (hp), add music
-Add animations 
-Add posibility to shot by player

- In the distance future i'll try to write interpreter for making game-Levels, which make it easier and easy for everyone

#instalation:
1. install sfml library on your computer
2. Make project with my files
3. Add your own textures, or write to me to send you mine
